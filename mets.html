[Verse 1]<p></p>
Up on his horse, up on his horse<p></p>
Not gonna wake up here anymore<p></p>
Listen one time, it's not the truth<p></p>
It's just a story I tell to you<p></p>
Easy to say, easy to do<p></p>
But it's not easy, well, maybe for you<p></p>
Hope that you find it, hope that it's good<p></p>
Hope that you read it, think that you should<p></p>
Cuts you some slack as he sits back<p></p>
Sizes you up, plans his attack<p></p>
<br>
[Spoken]<p></p>
Da-da-da<p></p>
Drums please, Fab<p></p>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<p></p>
And I got it all, I got it all<p></p>
Waitin' for me down on the street<p></p>
But now you gotta do somethin' special for me<p></p>
I'm gonna say what's on my mind<p></p>
Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine<p></p>
<br>
[Chorus]<p></p>
Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back<p></p>
I will not show my teeth too quick<p></p>
I needed you there, I needed you there<p></p>
But I didn't know, I didn't know<p></p>
<br>
[Break]<p></p>
Go alone<p></p>
I'll go alone<p></p>
We'll go alone<p></p>
I'll go alone<p></p>
<br>
[Verse 2]<p></p>
Back from his trip, he's at the door<p></p>
When he gets back, he's on the phone<p></p>
Innocent eye, innocent heart<p></p>
No, it's not wrong, but it's not right<p></p>
Innocent time, out on his own<p></p>
Not gonna do that, fuck, I'm out of control<p></p>
I was just bored, playin' the guitar<p></p>
Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard<p></p>
<br>
[Chorus]<p></p>
It's the last one now, I can promise you that<p></p>
I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back<p></p>
<br>
[Outro]<p></p>
Gone now are the old times<p></p>
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing<p></p>
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us<p></p>
Old friends, long forgotten<p></p>
The old ways at the bottom of<p></p>
The ocean now has swallowed<p></p>
The only thing that's left is us<p></p>
So pardon the silence that you're hearing<p></p>
It's turnin' into a deafening, painful, shameful roar...<p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p</p>
