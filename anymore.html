            <p></p>
            [Verse 1]<p></p>
            You're not the same anymore<p></p>
            Don’t wanna play that game anymore<p></p>
            You'd make a better window than a door<p></p>
            Oh, the strangers, they implore<p></p>
            It gets so easy to ignore<p></p>
            Just like the girl next door<p></p>
            <br>
            [Chorus 1]<p></p>
            Uncle's house, it was noon<p></p>
            Sorry, boy, I can’t employ ya<p></p>
            You are strange, but I like you<p></p>
            Sorry, this is overdue<p></p>
            I promised I would do it right<p></p>
            Her and a boy on a Saturday night<p></p>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<p></p>
            And now the door slams shut<p></p>
            A child prisoner grows up<p></p>
            To seek his enemy's throat cut<p></p>
            (I'm on and on it, on and on and on it)<p></p>
            We're on the way, fuel the jet<p></p>
            Can see that what he wants, he gets<p></p>
            What does your sworn enemy regret?<p></p>
            <br>
            [Chorus 2]<p></p>
            I didn't know, I didn't care<p></p>
            I don't even understand<p></p>
            Did somethin' wrong, I wasn’t sure<p></p>
            Stay on top of this, or else<p></p>
            I was afraid, I fucked up<p></p>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah<p></p>
            I couldn’t change, it's too late<p></p>
            <br>
            [Verse 3]<p></p>
            And now it’s time to show up<p></p>
            Late again, I can't grow up<p></p>
            And now it's on me, they've given up<p></p>
            <br>
            [Chorus 3]<p></p>
            Uncle’s house, I forget<p></p>
            Violent tendencies I get<p></p>
            Your timing sucks, she went overboard<p></p>
            Don't forget, you are insured<p></p>
            I didn't know, I wasn't sure<p></p>
            Can't remember all that well<p></p>
            I couldn't change, was too late<p></p>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah<p></p>
    <p></p>
