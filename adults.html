             [Verse 1]<p></p>

            They've been sayin' you're sophisticated<p></p>
            They're complainin', overeducated<p></p>
            You are saying all the words I'm dreaming<p></p>
            Say it after me<p></p>
            Say it after me<p></p>
            They will blame us, crucify and shame us<p></p>
            We can't help it if we are a problem<p></p>
            We are tryin' hard to get your attention<p></p>
            I'm climbin' up your wall<p></p>
            Climbin' up your wall<p></p>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<p></p>
            Don't go there 'cause you'll never return<p></p>
            I know you think of me when you think of her<p></p>
            But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard<p></p>
            To do the right thing, but without recompense<p></p>
            And then you did something wrong and you said it was great<p></p>
            And now you don't know how you could ever complain<p></p>
            Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to<p></p>
            But then you want me to do it the same as you<p></p>
            <br>
            [Instrumental Break]<p></p>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<p></p>
            You were waitin' for the elevator<p></p>
            You were sayin' all the words I'm dreaming<p></p>
            No more askin', questions, or excuses<p></p>
            The information's here<p></p>
            Here and everywhere<p></p>
            
            <br>
            [Chorus]<p></p>
            Don't go there 'cause you'll never return<p></p>
            I know you think of me when you think of her<p></p>
            But then it donâ€™t make sense when you're trying hard<p></p>
            To do the right thing but without recompense<p></p>
            And then you did something wrong and you said it was great<p></p>
            And now you don't know how you could ever complain<p></p>
            Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to<p></p>
            But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and but<p></p>

            [Bridge]<p></p>
            I don't, I don't want anything<p></p>
            I know it's not, it's not your fault<p></p>
            I don't want anyone<p></p>
            As I do it's not for you<p></p>
            <br>

            [Break]<p></p>
            Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah<p></p>
            Ah-ah, ooh, ooh<p></p>

            [Outro]<p></p>
            Stockholders<p></p>
            Same shit, a different life<p></p>
            I'll get it right sometime<p></p>
            Oh, maybe not tonight<p></p>
            Oh, maybe not tonight<p></p>
            Oh, maybe not tonight<p></p>
            Oh, maybe not tonight<p></p>
            Oh, maybe not tonight<p></p>
