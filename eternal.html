 [Intro]<p></p>
This, and I never let it happen<p></p>
Hey, yeah, oh<p></p>
Hey, yeah, oh<p></p>
<br>
[Verse 1]<p></p>
When I think of you<p></p>
It's always on my mind<p></p>
Is that story true?<p></p>
No one saves the day (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Don't you want the truth?<p></p>
Ignore reality<p></p>
See, I love that feeling too<p></p>
Nobody's gonna stop right now (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<p></p>
Summer is coming, won't go away<p></p>
Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
<br>
[Chorus]<p></p>
I can't believe it<p></p>
This is the eleventh hour<p></p>
Psychedelic<p></p>
Life is such a funny journey<p></p>
Hercules, your service is no longer needed<p></p>
It's just like make-believe (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<p></p>
They got the remedy<p></p>
But they won't let it happen<p></p>
Yeah, they got the remedy<p></p>
But they won't let it happen (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
(Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
<br>
[Verse 2]<p></p>
Now that you heard the truth<p></p>
All I need a friendly face<p></p>
I hate that feeling too<p></p>
But no one's unafraid (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Don't expect the truth<p></p>
This is a fantasy<p></p>
I fight that feeling too<p></p>
But nobody's gonna stop us now (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<p></p>
Summer is coming, won't go away<p></p>
Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Lo and behold the salt of the city<p></p>
Pillars like time are fading away<p></p>
Symphony building up to a future<p></p>
Mystery to solve for somebody else (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
<br>
[Chorus]<p></p>
I can't believe it<p></p>
Life is such a funny journey<p></p>
Psychedelic<p></p>
This is the eleventh hour<p></p>
Hercules, your service is no longer needed<p></p>
It's just like make-believe<p></p>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<p></p>
They got the remedy<p></p>
But they won't let it happen<p></p>
Yeah, they got the remedy<p></p>
But they won't let it happen<p></p>
<br>
[Outro]<p></p>
Everybody's on the take<p></p>
Tell me, are you on the take too?<p></p>
Everybody's on the take<p></p>
Tell me, are you on the take too?<p></p>
(Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
(Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
(Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Look up on the bright side<p></p>
I'm not gonna give it to ya<p></p>
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Look up on the bright side<p></p>
I'm not gonna give it to ya<p></p>
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Look up on the bright side<p></p>
I'm not gonna give it to ya<p></p>
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
Look up on the bright side<p></p>
I'm not gonna give it to ya<p></p>
Look at it on the bright side (Hey, yeah, oh)<p></p>
    <p></p>
