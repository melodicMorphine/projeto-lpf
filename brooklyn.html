            <p></p>
            [Verse 1]<p></p>
            One shot is never enough<p></p>
            I just wait for us to go in circles<p></p>
            A lifetime of giving my all for you<p></p>
            (Hostile, give me a break<p></p>
            Don't say it's in the bottle of air)<p></p>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus]<p></p>
            And first, he would tell me I'm his friend<p></p>
            Actually, no thanks, I'm okay<p></p>
            And then he would send weird looks my way<p></p>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<p></p>
            I want new friends, but they don't want me<p></p>
            They're making plans while I watch TV<p></p>
            Thought it was you, but maybe it's me<p></p>
            I want new friends, but they don't want me<p></p>
            <br>
            [Post-Chorus]<p></p>
            And the '80s song, yeah, how did it go?<p></p>
            When they said, "This is the beginning of the best years"<p></p>
            Even though, false, break<p></p>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<p></p>
            One shot is never enough<p></p>
            I just wait for this to go into circles<p></p>
            And the distance from my room, is anything so necessary?<p></p>
            I was thinking about that thing that you said last night, so boring<p></p>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus]<p></p>
            And the '80s bands? Oh, where did they go?<p></p>
            Can we switch into the chorus right now?<p></p>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<p></p>
            I want new friends, but they don't want me<p></p>
            They have some fun, but then they just leave<p></p>
            Is it just them? Or maybe all me?<p></p>
            Why my new friends don't seem to want me<p></p>
            <br>
            [Post-Chorus]<p></p>
            Hurts my case, but that's okay<p></p>
            It hurts my case, but that's okay<p></p>
            We're dancing on a moonbeam<p></p>
            On and on and on and on and on<p></p>
            <br>
            [Bridge]<p></p>
            The deeper I get, the less that I know<p></p>
            That's the way that it go<p></p>
            The less that I know, the deeper I go<p></p>
            Juliet, I adore<p></p>
            The deeper I get, the less that I know<p></p>
            Diminishing returns, oh<p></p>
            <br>
            [Outro]<p></p>
            Oh, that's how it goes<p></p>
            All I wanna say<p></p>
            On another song<p></p>
            On another day<p></p>
            On another song<p></p>
            On another day<p></p>
            On another song<p></p>
            On another break<p></p>
    <p></p>
